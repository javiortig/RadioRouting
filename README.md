# RadioRouting with Arduino and hc-12
This is an arduino project to create communication between multiple sensors and a router.

This project was created to solve measurements issues on a farm with low cost solutions, based on a personal and simple communication protocol which sends all the data to a personal OpenHab (IoT).
